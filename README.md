Lab 6: Make ACPM App Fancy/Professional by Using Coverflow & Pop-up Menu

Objectives
Students have developed a “typical” and “standard” Animation College Programme Management (ACPM) App in previous tutorial. 
In this practical lab, students learn to make ACPM app more fancy and professional by using CoverFlow library.

Cover-flow Layout is an exciting topic in interface designing. 
It can act like a ViewPager with swiping to change content view, but also, the center item (selected one) is larger than another. 
This view style gives a 3D effect, easy to manipulate with the elements.

In this tutorial, students implement a powerful library to make a flow (carousel) layout for “View all Programmes” by using third-party library FeatureCoverFlow.
